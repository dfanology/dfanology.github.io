#### <u>About</u>

I am a research fellow at the University of Melbourne working broadly in the fields of nanotechnology, materials science, optics, and biology. My current research interests are lab-on-a-chip nanoscopy for biophysics, applied optics and lithography, and precision instrumentation. I originally trained as an electrical engineer and worked for a number of years designing electrical power distribution and control systems for industrial plants. My hobbies include swing dancing and flying light aircraft.
