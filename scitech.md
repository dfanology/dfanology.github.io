### EUV lithography / X-ray optics

Some technical notes on working with EUV for lithography:
- Using 2-beam [interference lithography](scitech/proj1.html) to achieve a world record 6 nm half-pitch resolution.
- Achromatic Talbot lithography for very efficient large-area patterning of periodic structures.
- Bessel beam lithography for serial writing with a non-diffracting, self-healing beam.
- X-ray diffraction optics calculations using RCWA.

### Micro- and nano-fabrication

Technical notes and tips for various topics in nano-fabrication:
- Working with PDMS and UV-PDMS including spin-coating curves.
- Electroplating nickel nanostructures.
- RIE-ICP plasma etching optimisation for III-V materials and Si features < 20 nm.
