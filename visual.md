"Leave thy home, O youth, and seek out alien shores ... Yield not to misfortune: the far-off Danube shall know thee, the cold North-wind and the untroubled kingdom of Canopus and the men who gaze on the new birth of Phoebus or upon his setting ..."  -- Petronius

Old friends from top to bottom: Alpha and Beta Centauri (the pointers), the Coalsack Nebula, the Southern Cross, Carina (and the false cross), the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds, Canopus, Achernar (the end of the river).
