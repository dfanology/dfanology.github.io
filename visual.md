Chor Minor (four minarets) Madrassah, Bukhara, Uzbekistan. The four minarets supposedly represent four of the world’s religions. Sketched on 27/7/2009.

Journal entry from that day: 
> “Drew Chor Minor and Taqi Sarrafon, met dude who kicked my arse at chess ([his] own shop, studies international economics). Then met Habiba and went to her house to make crib. Sick, got some seeds, slept outside, too hot. Total spent: $17.”

-- Petronius

Old friends from top to bottom: Alpha and Beta Centauri (the pointers), the Coalsack Nebula, the Southern Cross, Carina (and the false cross), the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds, Canopus, Achernar (the end of the river).
