title: About
---

I am currently a scientific researcher broadly in the fields of nanoscience, optics, biology, and micro-fabrication, with over 7 years' experience in experimental physics, engineering, and nanotechnology. This included thorough and extensive use of nanofabrication techniques in clean-room environments, in particular EUV lithography, e-beam lithography, 2PP lithography, Raman spectroscopy, fluorescence microscopy, and electron microscopy. I originally trained as an electrical engineer and worked for a number of years designing electrical power distribution and control systems for industrial plants. 

A short resume is listed below while some projects are described in more detail under "Science / Technology".
