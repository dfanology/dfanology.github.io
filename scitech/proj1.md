title: EUV interference lithography produces world record resolution
---

{:toc}

## Concept

Interference lithography relies on the recording in photoresist of the interference pattern produced from the intersection of two light beams. The first such systems used a mirror (in Lloyd's configuration) and a coherent laser source. Here the concept is extended in 2016 to it's technological limits: by using a spatially and temporally coherent x-ray light beam produced from a synchrotron source combined with a transmission diffraction grating to produce the interference pattern.

The wavelength chosen is **13.5 nm**, called extreme UV (EUV), a highly relevant wavelength used in industry for state-of-the-art microelectronics manufacturing due to the availability of sources, mirror materials, and suitable photoresists. A grating arrangement is used to maximize field of view and interference contrast as well as allowing temporal coherence requirements to be relaxed, since different wavelengths lead to the same aerial image.

Note that it is also possible to produce interference patterns from incoherent sources such as Talbot lithography or using holographic masks.

The Bragg equation gives:\

where p is the periodicity of the image, q is the periodicity of the grating, $\lambda$
