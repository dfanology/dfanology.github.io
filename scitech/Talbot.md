# Concept

Talbot observed in 1836 that monochromatic light passing through a diffraction grating produced repeated images of the grating at integer multiples of the Talbot distance $$z_{T}$$. For broadband light, the Talbot distance for each wavelength is different, so at some distance (let's call it the achromatic Talbot distance $$z_{A}$$) all the grating self-images corresponding to the different wavelengths merge and blur together to form a propagating grating image that is z-invariant. As the distance from the grating increases further, the diffraction orders stop overlapping (since they are propagating at an angle), and eventually only the 0<sup>th</sup>-order is left.

This means at the intermediate distance where the self-images are blurred together but not so far that interference stops, the aerial image is a z-invariant periodic pattern which can be used to pattern photoresist. Because of the z-invariance, it is robust to tilt and positioning, while
